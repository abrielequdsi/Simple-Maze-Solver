Simple Bread First Search based algorithms

1. Generate a set of all possible paths for a given maze
2. find shortest path in maze
3. generate list or a set of all possible routes and attempts
   each one until it finds the end node
4. Once the algorithm finds a path that reaches the end node
   it is guaranteed that this is the shortest possible path.
5. Not suitable for large data structures
